- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @eldct
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning R, SQL, and other data related skills for data management, analysis, and visualization. I've worked in the public health domain for a decade. 
- ðŸŒ± I spent much of my recent past working towards a PhD in epidemiology. Iâ€™m currently working on building a portfolio to highlight my skills for (non-academic) jobs.
